Design Patterns:

   are the reusable solutions to the common problems that are araise during the software design and develop phase.
  
  It will helps to collaborate with others easily and also understand problem easily
  It helps to speed up the development and robust software can build
  
  types:
  
  1.Creational Design Patterns
  2.Structural Design Patterns
  3.Behavioral Design Patterns
  
  >> Crearional Design Patterns:
   It abstract the instantiation process.They help in making system independent of how the object created,composed, and represnt. 
   
     >> Types of Creational Design Patterns
	     1.SingleTon Method
		 2.factory Method
		 3.Abstract factory Method
		 4.Builder Method
		 5.Prototype Method
		 6.object pool Method
  
 >>Structural Design Patterns:
    Structural Design Patterns are concerned to how the classes and object composed to form large structure.
	Structural Patterns use inheritance to compose the interfaces or implementations.
	
	>>Types of Structural Design Patterns
	      1.Adapter Method 
		  2.Bridge Method
		  3.Decorator Method
		  4.composite Method
		  5.Facade Method
		  6.Flyweight Method
		  7.proxy Method
		  8.private class data
		  
 >>Behavioral Design Patterns:
    It concerned about the way of interactions between the objects.(Communication)
	
	>>Types of Behavioral Design Patterns
	     1.chain of responsibility Method
		 2.command Method
		 3.Interpreter Method
		 4.Iterator Method
		 5.Mediator Method
		 6.Memento Method
		 7.Null object Method
		 8.Observer Method
		 9.State Method
		 10.Strategy Method
		 11.Templete Method
